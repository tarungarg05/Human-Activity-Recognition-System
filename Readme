The human ability to recognize another person’s activities is one of the main subjects of study of the scientific areas of computer vision and machine learning. 
It is a application based problem.
This work presents the Human Activity Recognition System architecture for the recognition of physical activities using a Smartphone.  It targets real-time classification with a collection of inertial sensors. 
So that we can identify human activities through smartphones using sensor data.
